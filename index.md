## Welcome to Club Lpl

Club Lpl may have the silliest name this side of the internet, but the idea is golden. Getting together as a group to learn and experiement with other programming languages. The biggest goal of this project is to help you find new and creative solutions to your day to day problems, by examining how other languages work, and more importantly, how they deal with those problems.

## Ideas/Thoughts

If you want to start a async discussion, or throw an idea on the board for some new language/technology to cover I highly recommend that you post it to the relative spot on our ideas project.
